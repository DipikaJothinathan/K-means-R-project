Objective: The objective of this project is to analyze various undergraduate majors to determine which fields offer the highest financial returns. Using a dataset from the WSJ PayScale survey of 1.2 million people, the study applies K-Means Clustering to categorize majors based on salary outcomes. The goal is to provide insights into which degrees yield the best long-term earning potential, aiding students in making informed career choices.

Summary
This project examines salary trends across different undergraduate majors, focusing on starting and mid-career earnings. The K-Means Clustering method was applied to identify high-earning degree fields. Key findings include:
1. Highest Paying Majors: STEM fields (e.g., Aerospace, Chemical, Computer, and Electrical Engineering) with salaries ranging from $60K - $100K+.
2. Moderate Paying Majors: Business degrees, with mid-career salaries between $45K - $60K.
3. Lowest Paying Majors: Arts and humanities, earning $34K - $44K on average.

The study highlights the financial benefits of STEM degrees while emphasizing the importance of informed educational choices. The project faced challenges in data processing and teamwork coordination, leading to valuable lessons in collaboration, data visualization, and model optimization.
